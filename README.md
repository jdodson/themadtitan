# themadtitan
A script that implements Thanos terrible will.

To prepare myself for Avengers Endgame, and to have some fun I decided to write a script
takes a list of people and at the snap of Thanos fingers, turns half of them to dust.  Because
that's some crazy mad terrible code (to kill half of anyone in a list) it's written in Perl.  

I don't mean any offense to Perl, I just thought it's funnier to write this in Perl.

Feel free to edit the script, add your friends to the list and see who lives and who is
left to AVENGE the fallen!  I know a zillion people did this in some web app somewhere but
I wanted this evil to be written in Perl.

Not a Perl expert, so if you have patches to make this better, feel free to submit.

# how this works

Will work out of the box on any Mac and Ubuntu machine in the terminal:

```
perl the_mad_titan.pl
```

# sample output from the script

```
perl the_mad_titan.pl
```

Thanos: "It was. And it was beautiful. Titan was like most planets. Too many mouths, not enough to go around. And when we faced extinction, I offered a solution.  At random. Dispassionate, fair. The rich and poor alike. And they called me a madman. And what I predicted, came to pass."

THE MAD TITAN SNAPS HIS FINGERS!

The people who become dust: [ "The Winter Soldier" "Spider-Man" "Captain America" "Bruce Banner" "Doctor Strange" "Drax" "Iron Man" "Mantis" "Thor"  ]

Avengers Assemble! [ "War Machine" "Starlord" "Black Widow" "Black Panther" "Vision" "Rocket Racoon" "Scarlet Witch" "Groot" "Gamora"  ]
