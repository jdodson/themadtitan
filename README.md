# themadtitan
A script that implements Thanos terrible will.

To prepare myself for Avengers Endgame, and to have some fun I decided to write a script
takes a list of people and at the snap of Thanos fingers, turns half of them to dust.  Because
that's some crazy mad terrible code (to kill half of anyone in a list) it's written in Perl.  
I don't mean any offense to Perl, I just thought it's a funny joke.

Feel free to edit the script, add your friends to the list and see who lives and who is
left to AVENGE the fallen!  I know a zillion people did this in some web app somewhere but
I wanted this evil to be written in Perl.

Not a Perl expert, so if you have patches to make this better, feel free to submit.

# how this works

Will work out of the box on any Mac and Ubuntu machine in the terminal:

```
perl the_mad_titan.pl
```
